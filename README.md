# Peter Kuma: Research Summary

## About Me

I am an atmospheric physics PhD student at the University of Canterbury
in Christchurch, New Zealand, currently focusing on research of climate in
the Southern Ocean with the aim of improving accurracy of climate models in
this region. My research is funded  by
the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/) and
[New Zealand Deep South Challenge](https://www.deepsouthchallenge.co.nz/).
