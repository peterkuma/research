# Peter Kuma: Research Summary

## About Me

I am an atmospheric physics PhD student at the
[School of Physical and Chemical Sciences](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/phys-chem/), University of Canterbury
in Christchurch, New Zealand, currently focusing on research of climate in
the Southern Ocean with the aim of improving accuracy of climate models in
this region. My research is funded by
the University of Canterbury and the
[New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge](https://www.deepsouthchallenge.co.nz/).

**PhD Supervisor:** Prof. Adrian McDonald, University of Canterbury\
**PhD Co-supervisor:** Dr. Olaf Morgenstern, NIWA
